  <h1>About Uno</h1>
  <p>UNO is the classic family card game that's easy to pick up and impossible to put down! Players take turns matching
    a card in their hand with the current card shown on top of the deck either by color or number. Special action cards,
    like Skips, Reverses, Draw Twos, color-changing Wild and Draw Four Wild cards, deliver game-changing moments as they
    each perform a function to help you defeat your opponents. If you can't make a match, you must draw from the center
    pile. And when you're down to one card, don't forget to shout 'UNO!' The first player to get rid of all the cards in
    their hand wins. Now card game-lovers can get UNO in a sturdy tin that's great for travel and makes storage
    stress-free. Colors and decorations may vary</p>
